		// Lead Factors
		//	These define a range - [minLeadFactor, maxLeadFactor] -

		//	actor will lead its target when using a projectile
		//	weapon.  A factor of 0 indicates the position where
		//	the target is presently; a factor of 1 indicates the
		//	position where the target is predicted to be at
		//	impact, taking into account the target's current
		//	motion.  Each time the actor fires a projectile,
		//	a random number in this range is chosen and applied
		//	as the lead factor for that shot.  Thus, [0,0] means
		//	the actor never leads his target; [1,1] means he
		//	always leads it perfectly; [0,2] means he sometimes
		//	over-leads and sometimes under-leads it.
